# 📂 JDirPrinter Browser (Text Explorer)

> **Transform static text directory logs into an interactive, navigable file explorer.**

A single-file, client-side web application that parses `dir /s` style text logs (specifically JDirPrinter outputs) and visualizes them as a modern, searchable file system. No server required—everything runs locally in your browser.

## ✨ Features

*   **Zero Dependencies:** Runs entirely in a single HTML file. No installation needed.
*   **Drag & Drop:** Simply drag your `.txt` log file onto the window to load.
*   **Dual View Modes:** Toggle between **Grid View** (large icons) and **List View** (detailed columns).
*   **Advanced Search:**
    *   **Local:** Filter files within the current folder.
    *   **Global:** Recursive search across the entire directory structure.
    *   **Settings:** Toggle between "Instant Search" (as you type) or "Manual" (Enter key).
*   **Smart Size Calculation:** Automatically calculates recursive folder sizes (shown in blue), even if the original text log didn't explicitly list folder totals.
*   **Data Validation:** Checks the parsed file count and size against the log's "Directory of" headers.
    *   🟢 **Green:** Parsed data matches the log metadata.
    *   🔴 **Red:** Mismatch detected (useful for debugging incomplete logs).
*   **Customization:**
    *   Dark / Light Theme toggle.
    *   Zoom slider (scales grid size and font).
*   **Rich File Type Styling:** Color-coded gradients for Video, Audio, Images, Archives, and Documents.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Download:** Save the `JDirPrinter Browser.html` file to your computer.
2.  **Open:** Double-click the file to open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3.  **Load Data:** Drag and drop a compatible text file (generated by JDirPrinter or `dir /s` commands) onto the browser window.
4.  **Explore:** Navigate folders, search for files, and sort by name/size/date just like a real OS explorer.

## 📄 Input File Format

The parser is optimized for standard Windows command line directory listings or JDirPrinter exports. A compatible file structure looks like this:

```text
 Directory of D:\MyFiles\Photos

01/15/2023  02:30 PM    <DIR>          .
01/15/2023  02:30 PM    <DIR>          ..
01/10/2023  10:00 AM         2,450,111 image01.jpg
01/11/2023  11:20 AM         1,024,000 document.pdf
              2 File(s)      3,474,111 bytes

 Directory of D:\MyFiles\Music
 ...
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

*   **Parsing Logic:** Uses regex to identify headers (`Directory of`), footers (`Total ... file(s)`), and file lines (Date/Time/Size/Name).
*   **State Management:** Maintains a history stack for navigation (Back/Forward buttons).
*   **Performance:** Uses a virtual DOM approach for rendering lists and grids to handle large text files efficiently.
*   **Privacy:** **100% Local.** The text file is parsed in your browser's memory. No data is ever uploaded to a server.
